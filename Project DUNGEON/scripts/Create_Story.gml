var page_1 = "In a strange era in a stranger world, exists a land known as Unestris. For eons, it has been the home to countless cultures and civilizations. As such, it has also been the home to countless wars and meaningless bloodshed. Leaders, Nations, Alliances, none will stay for long. The only constant in Unestris is that there will never be any.";

var page_2 = "The last 1000 years have been a time of peace, forged by the six nations of The League: The Empire. The Republic. The Tribes. The States. The Church. The Kingdom. A bond of unity formed to protect the future of Unestris. All disputes, potential wars, and invaders are struck down by The League. It is thanks to the League that Unestris enjoys the longest period of peace it has ever had.";

var page_3 = "At the heart of the land layed a 7th realm, Centinno, which acted as the neutral mediator for The League. 'Unestrian Arbiter', an accurate title. The League may be the face of Unestrian peace, but Centinno holds the real authority.";

var page_4 = "Centinno held power over The League. It's location in the center of Unestris gave it control over all major trade routes. It's King was loved and respected by all Unestrians. No one nation dared challenge his authority. Some say Centinno is the oldest nation in the League, but nobody knows for sure, the records long lost ago. Nobody knows, except the people of Centinno.";

var page_5 = "The League was headed by a northern Kingdom, ruled by a family respected for their wisdom and foresight. At this time, the family was a King who loved his people, and his daughter, the princess. The Kingdom prided itself on holding respect second only to Centinno.";

var page_6 = "One day, the King recieved a message that Centinno was hiding something, something that could tear Unestris apart. He could not believe it. But.... something about this message seemed wrong. For one, the message appeared out of nowhere, and was awfully vague. Still, not one to take matters lightly, he summoned The League for council.";

var page_7 = "On the day the council convened, a shocking truth emerged. As it happens, all six nations recieved the same warning. But was it true? The States had their elite diviners ask the heavens for the answer, and they confirmed it. Although they could not tell the exact nature of it, Centinno indeed held a dark secret, and it could spell the end of Unestris.";

var page_8 = "For once, Centinno was under suspicion. It's King denied that his country was any threat to them. But the seers insisted otherwise. The seers were known as the Eyes of the League, and their vision was never clouded. Even still, Centinno proclaimed their innocence. The League and it's Arbiter were in a deadlock.";

var page_9 = "As the King pondered what to do, The Empire and The Church declared an ultimatum: The League must unite and conquer this threat, or the 1000 year peace shall be shattered. The choice was easy.";

var page_10 = "The League nations united their forces, a greater and more diverse army there never was. At the sound of their horns, they entered Centinno, and the invasion had begun.";

//War arc
var page_11 = "As the army crossed the border, the citizens ran in fear. Centuries of playing arbiter had left Centinno without a proper military. Nothing could stop the invading force. Eventually, the soldiers surrounded a small village, raised their swords, then dropped them to the ground.";

var page_12 = "In the end, the soldiers could not attack. Or rather, they would not. The love and respect they held for this land's king was greater than any loyalty they had for their lieges. Once they realized this, they returned to their homes, and declared that not a single drop of Centinnian blood would be spilled.";

var page_13 = "This was not a lone case. There wasn't a single soldier in all Unestris who would dare attack Centinno, even the most cold blooded assassins held love for that country. There was no spell or trickery at work, the entire population simply would not harm Centinno. Any invasion would end in failure.";

var page_14 = "Over the next year, The League tried everything to gain control of Centinno. Spies, Magic, siege. Nothing could break the iron clad black box that this country was hiding in.";

var page_15 = "Eventually, the people became weary of this war. Heavy taxes had been raised in erecting a massive wall around Centinno, hoping to starve them out. It was pointless. All it had achieved was in isolating a beloved realm. To make matters worse, nobody even knew what exactly the threat was. Why fight a war without a cause?";

var page_16 = "The League was about ready to give up, their campaign completely fruitless. Until one day, when they were approached by a messenger, concealed in heavy robes. They claimed they were the one who sent the initial warning. As it turns out, They knew of a way to conquer Centinno and end this farce. All they would have to do, is create a new one.";
